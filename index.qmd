Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto. My research focuses on understanding the experiences of Russian diasporas through the lens of political communication and media, analyzing the ways in which Kremlin-linked actors work to develop a global "Ruski Mir." 

In addition to my work in academia, I am a Senior Analyst at Global Affairs Canada where I support research and analysis of Kremlin disinformation narratives and their resonance and impact within countries throughout East-Central Europe. 

If you would like to know more, connect on Twitter, Linkedin, or email me at rutykorotaev [at] gmail [dot] com.
