Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Information. My research focuses on understanding the experiences of Russian diasporas through the lens of political communication and media, analyzing the ways in which Kremlin-linked actors seek to develop a "Ruski Mir" globally. 

In addition to my work in academia, I am a Senior Analyst on the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism, based at Global Affairs Canada, and work to support research and analysis of Kremlin disinformation narratives and their resonance within countries throughout East-Central Europe.
